# BFS Tree Search

A simple Python implementation of **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** using `Node` and `Queue` classes.  
Designed for experimenting with graph traversal and shortest-path problems.

---

## Features
- **Node class** with parent references for reconstructing paths.
- **Queue class** for BFS frontier.
- Detects visited nodes to avoid infinite loops.
- Example usage with a sample graph.

---

## Usage

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jjabs-01/BFS_tree_search.git
cd BFS_tree_search
